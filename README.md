# Simple CRM using Golang

This is a simple **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system built using **Golang**, **Fiber**, and **GORM**. The application allows you to manage customer data, such as creating, reading, and deleting leads (potential customers). The project also demonstrates how to use **SQLite** for storing the data.

## Features

- **Create Leads**: Add new customer leads to the system.
- **View Leads**: Fetch all leads or a specific lead based on the lead ID.
- **Delete Leads**: Soft delete customer leads by ID.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support for lead management.

## Technologies Used

- **Golang**: The backend language used to build the application.
- **Fiber**: A fast, minimalist web framework for Go to handle routing and requests.
- **GORM**: Object Relational Mapping (ORM) for Go to interact with SQLite database.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight relational database to store lead information.
- **Postman**: Used for API testing.

## Setup Instructions

To get this CRM up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Make sure Go is installed on your machine (version 1.18 or later).
- **Git**: Make sure Git is installed to clone the repository.
- **SQLite**: Ensure that the SQLite database is properly configured or will be automatically created when running the application.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Simple-CRM-using-Golang.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Simple-CRM-using-Golang
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

5. The application will start a server on `http://localhost:3000`.

6. You can now use **Postman** or any other HTTP client to test the following API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

- **GET `/api/v1/lead`**: Fetch all leads.
- **GET `/api/v1/lead/:id`**: Fetch a lead by its ID.
- **POST `/api/v1/lead`**: Create a new lead.
- **DELETE `/api/v1/lead/:id`**: Delete a lead by its ID.

### Example Request:

#### Create a new Lead (POST):
```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "company": "Tech Corp",
    "email": "johndoe@techcorp.com",
    "phone": "1234567890"
}
```

#### Get all Leads (GET):
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "company": "Tech Corp",
    "email": "johndoe@techcorp.com",
    "phone": "1234567890"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "company": "Business Inc.",
    "email": "janedoe@businessinc.com",
    "phone": "9876543210"
  }
]
```

#### Delete a Lead (DELETE):
Send a `DELETE` request to `/api/v1/lead/:id` to delete the lead by ID.
